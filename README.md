# JavaBomber
A simple Bomber Man clone made in Java using the LibGDX library. It was developed as a university project for the exam "Metodologie di Programmazione". 
I was given some starting classes with extremely basic implementations to show how the rendering and player controls work on the LibGDX library and then asked
to develop the "Entity" portion of the game. As I was in charge of programming the Entity section, this project doesen't have any sound, men√π or map selection.

The project includes a playable demo, complete with a playable character, a base enemy, a boss with particular interactions, a basic map with unbreakable and breakable tiles and a varied set of classic Bomberman power-ups. 
The sprites are taken from a free spreadsheet site, I handled the animation in the code with a basic way to cycle through sprites based on the action performed
by the entity.

The project scored a 28 out of 30 during evaluation.
